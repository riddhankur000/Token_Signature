Therefore, if Marvin is an extraterrestrial, he cannot be a human. \n\nFrom the premises, we also know that all highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.

For example, a person may eat salads because they enjoy the taste or because they are trying to lose weight, not necessarily because they are very conscious about their health. \n\nAdditionally, the premises suggest that people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes are more likely to fulfill their daily nutritional intakes, but this is not always the case. There are many other factors that can influence a person's ability to meet their daily nutritional needs, such as their access to healthy food options and their level of physical activity. \n\nFinally, the premises suggest that people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits, but this is also not always the case. There may be other factors that contribute to a person's health and well-being, such as their mental health and their social support network. \n\nOverall, while the premises provide some evidence that Taylor may eat salads regularly, there are many other factors that could influence her eating habits and health outcomes.

Therefore, Tower B must be located in New Haven, as it is the only option left. \n\nSo, the conclusion is true that Tower B is located in New Haven.", "token_ids": [415, 12886, 349, 1132, 325, 28741, 609, 28705, 13, 13, 15423, 28742, 28713, 272, 24685, 28747, 28705, 13, 13, 28740, 28723, 3672, 272, 5146, 3900, 28725, 478, 873, 369, 544, 9702, 297, 1450, 24077, 460, 459, 1486, 28723, 28705, 13, 28750, 28723, 816, 835, 873, 369, 19895, 330, 349, 6900, 486, 28362, 382, 23291, 28725, 690, 2825, 378, 349, 5651, 297, 1450, 24077, 28723, 28705, 13, 28770, 28723, 4577, 19895, 330, 349, 5651, 297, 1450, 24077, 304, 349, 459, 1486, 28725, 378, 3573, 347, 19895, 365, 28725, 690, 659, 272, 23451, 4146, 16388, 304, 349, 5651, 297, 2213, 28716, 1061, 509, 28723, 28705, 13, 28781, 28723, 8469, 28725, 19895, 365, 1580, 347, 5651, 297, 1450, 24077, 28725, 390, 378, 349, 272, 865, 3551, 1749, 28723, 28705, 13, 13, 5142, 28725, 272, 12886, 349, 1132, 369, 19895, 365, 349, 5651, 297, 1450, 24077, 28723], "token_probs": [0.6193228960037231, 0.9611058831214905, 0.9131230711936951, 0.3685939610004425, 0.603639543056488, 0.9986074566841125, 0.9711876511573792, 0.398032009601593, 0.9996702671051025, 0.8863354325294495, 0.2764415442943573, 0.9613149166107178, 0.9999994039535522, 0.829782247543335, 0.9712767004966736, 0.9027965068817139, 0.6220186352729797, 0.9998651742935181, 0.8678785562515259, 0.8131473660469055, 0.9999566078186035, 0.29129815101623535, 0.9644922614097595, 0.8933448195457458, 0.9874691963195801, 0.984226405620575, 0.9985364675521851, 0.9697030186653137, 0.9991596937179565, 0.9393250942230225, 0.9982518553733826, 0.6424005031585693, 0.9923428893089294, 0.9997895359992981, 0.9976818561553955, 0.9998832941055298, 0.9997296929359436, 0.7016422748565674, 0.7034409642219543, 0.999991774559021, 0.9950442314147949, 0.9999978542327881, 0.6013462543487549, 0.9971696734428406, 0.999923825263977, 0.9996261596679688, 0.880100667476654, 0.562026858329773, 0.9855251908302307, 0.9946622252464294, 0.9999866485595703, 0.9999730587005615, 0.9998040795326233, 0.9999995231628418, 0.6528007388114929, 0.6930243372917175, 0.6201658248901367, 0.6375595927238464, 0.9240747094154358, 0.8689244389533997, 0.9993811845779419, 0.9973625540733337, 0.9998970031738281, 0.7248806953430176, 0.9944397211074829, 1.0, 0.9999823570251465, 0.9999992847442627, 0.5606000423431396, 0.842785120010376, 0.995625376701355, 0.998484194278717, 0.6389066576957703, 0.9999575614929199, 0.9996862411499023, 0.9994609951972961, 0.6786317229270935, 0.5115104913711548, 0.9878233671188354, 0.9882806539535522, 0.9983774423599243, 0.7382457256317139, 0.31392353773117065, 0.9989820122718811, 0.8455354571342468, 0.9998779296875, 0.46006566286087036, 0.8798632025718689, 0.795886754989624, 0.9982864260673523, 0.9994577765464783, 0.9999967813491821, 0.9999892711639404, 0.935989260673523, 0.9995434880256653, 0.9478082060813904, 0.9999599456787109, 0.8040195107460022, 0.9991948008537292, 0.9996132254600525, 0.9999490976333618, 0.9689971208572388, 0.9987553358078003, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9999141693115234, 0.9999991655349731, 0.940701425075531, 0.9999903440475464, 0.6550037264823914, 0.9874745607376099, 0.9364488124847412, 0.9992066025733948, 0.9711810350418091, 0.9940191507339478, 0.9508633613586426, 0.999798595905304, 0.56694096326828, 0.661388635635376, 0.6879511475563049, 0.9817944765090942, 0.8291772603988647, 0.999113142490387, 0.4043838381767273, 0.9239798784255981, 0.9628727436065674, 0.5243194699287415, 0.9999545812606812, 0.8149303197860718, 0.6779777407646179, 0.7046487331390381, 0.97934889793396, 0.9993414282798767, 0.7933938503265381, 0.8782718181610107, 0.48491960763931274, 0.9999939203262329, 0.9998376369476318, 0.9999645948410034, 0.9999797344207764, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9999935626983643, 0.9996088147163391, 0.9996360540390015], "len_token": 143, "len_probs": 143}

Since two is positive, the double of two (which is four) is also positive. \n5. We know that eight is the double of four, so eight is positive. \n6. Since six is the sum of five and one, and five is positive, six is also positive. \n7.

Therefore, it is uncertain whether John will be approved for a mortgage based solely on the premises provided.", "token_ids": [415, 12886, 349, 12518, 325, 28743, 609, 4023, 378, 349, 1132, 369, 905, 693, 1558, 339, 652, 15556, 356, 727, 506, 264, 1486, 6183, 7420, 28725, 304, 741, 905, 395, 1486, 6183, 14428, 304, 1486, 3823, 4838, 460, 12879, 354, 5461, 28721, 1291, 28725, 378, 349, 459, 11867, 1132, 369, 2215, 622, 347, 12879, 354, 264, 18222, 513, 400, 1558, 748, 516, 15556, 356, 727, 28723, 1387, 460, 1287, 799, 8612, 369, 305, 14930, 1917, 739, 2151, 3844, 5461, 28721, 1291, 28725, 1259, 390, 6183, 3340, 28725, 10953, 28733, 532, 28733, 1814, 525, 10554, 28725, 304, 1060, 8850, 3558, 28723, 8469, 28725, 378, 349, 12518, 3161, 2215, 622, 347, 12879, 354, 264, 18222, 2818, 19550, 356, 272, 5146, 3900, 3857, 28723], "token_probs": [0.5979238152503967, 0.9809253811836243, 0.8745364546775818, 0.6152825355529785, 0.8544420003890991, 0.9921956062316895, 0.7238977551460266, 0.5750228762626648, 0.6920453906059265, 0.9051429629325867, 0.9185686707496643, 0.999455988407135, 0.46637919545173645, 0.7057310938835144, 0.9701341986656189, 0.9999849796295166, 0.9971638321876526, 0.9999933242797852, 0.9998987913131714, 0.999947190284729, 0.34077027440071106, 0.9623498320579529, 0.9958462119102478, 0.9999974966049194, 0.999993085861206, 0.6222214102745056, 0.5085725784301758, 0.8469215631484985, 0.9993786811828613, 0.9998196959495544, 0.9960612654685974, 0.9989190101623535, 0.9999827146530151, 0.9967489242553711, 0.9991699457168579, 0.999909520149231, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9998507499694824, 0.9999762773513794, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9999934434890747, 0.999998927116394, 0.9999926090240479, 0.9994101524353027, 0.4919688403606415, 0.7489091753959656, 0.961120069026947, 0.5734341740608215, 0.7082116007804871, 0.9998660087585449, 0.9796050786972046, 0.8301899433135986, 0.9985218644142151, 0.9999169111251831, 0.9999895095825195, 0.9999858140945435, 0.9999802112579346, 0.5090939998626709, 0.9999513626098633, 0.9963892698287964, 0.9999604225158691, 0.9999619722366333, 0.9999709129333496, 0.9999592304229736, 0.9999841451644897, 0.9444720149040222, 0.37778177857398987, 0.48490777611732483, 0.7898781895637512, 0.5617931485176086, 0.9999483823776245, 0.9979444146156311, 0.5555699467658997, 0.9999958276748657, 0.9907867312431335, 0.9997313618659973, 0.9430062174797058, 0.9999222755432129, 0.5636821389198303, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999680519104004, 0.9994454979896545, 0.816216766834259, 0.9999996423721313, 0.3678416311740875, 0.9891138076782227, 0.999945878982544, 0.6734166741371155, 0.9990574717521667, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9999959468841553, 0.9999434947967529, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999850988388062, 0.9999964237213135, 0.8082725405693054, 0.3825577199459076, 0.9991544485092163, 0.6773650646209717, 0.835415780544281, 0.38901811838150024, 0.9999744892120361, 0.7164132595062256, 0.9519038796424866, 0.6411056518554688, 0.9308102130889893, 0.9245111346244812, 0.988243579864502, 0.9881147146224976, 0.9997184872627258, 0.9998736381530762, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9999748468399048, 0.8152886629104614, 0.7490860819816589, 0.999994158744812, 0.5142192244529724, 0.9230921268463135, 0.9940458536148071, 0.9028410911560059, 0.9994392991065979], "len_token": 121, "len_probs": 121}

Since we don't have enough information to determine whether John is a Teaching Fellow or not, the conclusion is uncertain (C).", "token_ids": [415, 12886, 349, 1341, 325, 28760, 609, 28705, 13, 13, 15423, 28742, 28713, 272, 24685, 28747, 28705, 13, 13, 28740, 28723, 3672, 272, 5146, 3900, 28725, 478, 873, 369, 544, 25167, 3567, 460, 16174, 3567, 28723, 28705, 13, 28750, 28723, 816, 835, 873, 369, 741, 25167, 3567, 460, 2263, 10028, 401, 479, 3611, 28723, 28705, 13, 28770, 28723, 2993, 28725, 478, 949, 28742, 28707, 873, 513, 2215, 349, 264, 25167, 5716, 442, 264, 16174, 5716, 28723, 28705, 13, 28781, 28723, 8469, 28725, 378, 28742, 28713, 2572, 369, 2215, 349, 264, 16174, 5716, 304, 264, 2263, 10028, 23783, 28725, 690, 682, 1038, 272, 12886, 1132, 28723, 28705, 13, 28782, 28723, 1092, 378, 28742, 28713, 835, 2572, 369, 2215, 349, 459, 264, 16174, 5716, 442, 264, 2263, 10028, 23783, 28725, 690, 682, 1038, 272, 12886, 1341, 28723, 28705, 13, 28784, 28723, 4577, 478, 949, 28742, 28707, 506, 2066, 1871, 298, 7655, 3161, 2215, 349, 264, 2263, 10028, 23783, 442, 459, 28725, 272, 12886, 349, 12518, 325, 28743, 609], "token_probs": [0.7018636465072632, 0.9730483293533325, 0.8987428545951843, 0.5207409858703613, 0.5114978551864624, 0.9972757697105408, 0.9756195545196533, 0.6529719829559326, 0.9996960163116455, 0.8628935217857361, 0.3194035589694977, 0.9346615672111511, 0.9999996423721313, 0.7354567050933838, 0.9229229092597961, 0.8834628462791443, 0.797774612903595, 0.9999926090240479, 0.920378565788269, 0.4953175485134125, 0.9999181032180786, 0.3803306818008423, 0.9690307974815369, 0.8731802701950073, 0.9932183623313904, 0.9818591475486755, 0.9968270659446716, 0.8914569616317749, 0.9999504089355469, 0.726238489151001, 0.9652848243713379, 0.9999768733978271, 0.9994450211524963, 0.9086101651191711, 0.9999957084655762, 0.6970657706260681, 0.830971896648407, 0.9999979734420776, 0.9946921467781067, 0.9999990463256836, 0.31419801712036133, 0.9903721809387207, 0.9998738765716553, 0.9997816681861877, 0.9316455125808716, 0.9988991022109985, 0.9999885559082031, 0.9995291233062744, 0.995719850063324, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9999866485595703, 0.9999732971191406, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9230815768241882, 0.9979990124702454, 1.0, 0.9999661445617676, 0.9999996423721313, 0.3749825358390808, 0.9999933242797852, 0.6058354377746582, 0.6370249390602112, 0.9999315738677979, 0.9999998807907104, 0.8338389992713928, 0.5830262303352356, 0.9376688599586487, 0.9489994049072266, 0.9579582810401917, 0.9541191458702087, 0.991847038269043, 0.808600902557373, 0.7589135766029358, 0.6943560838699341, 0.9999842643737793, 0.6608388423919678, 0.9765867590904236, 0.9999971389770508, 0.9997188448905945, 0.9999996423721313, 0.30025577545166016, 0.9999918937683105, 0.34456056356430054, 0.6695738434791565, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9523048996925354, 0.9993168115615845, 0.9986599683761597, 0.9522839188575745, 0.9582473039627075, 0.5015941858291626, 0.9998513460159302, 0.4989284574985504, 0.7877310514450073, 0.9915158748626709, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9996747970581055, 0.5867113471031189, 0.9137349724769592, 0.7458199262619019, 0.6700085401535034, 0.8297103643417358, 0.9507583975791931, 0.6745919585227966, 0.8807395100593567, 0.9879229664802551, 0.9999895095825195, 0.9857150912284851, 0.9999879598617554, 0.605474054813385, 0.44231078028678894, 0.9997277855873108, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9978036284446716, 0.9999116659164429, 0.9999926090240479, 0.9998098015785217, 0.9981739521026611, 0.7445405721664429, 0.9994871616363525, 0.7950416803359985, 0.9995444416999817, 0.4511451721191406, 0.9821585416793823, 0.5581470727920532, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9997596144676208, 0.9802556037902832, 0.9568085074424744, 0.9990538954734802, 0.9969680905342102, 0.9999773502349854, 0.9999227523803711, 0.9976887702941895, 0.999537467956543, 0.9035887718200684, 0.9999784231185913, 0.9355663657188416, 0.9999966621398926, 0.7959193587303162, 0.6594120264053345, 0.9875931143760681, 0.9999969005584717, 1.0, 0.9997761845588684, 0.9979275465011597, 0.9990872144699097, 0.8211528658866882, 0.919033408164978, 0.41721203923225403, 0.985101044178009, 0.9785334467887878, 0.9982853531837463, 0.8741819262504578, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9998518228530884, 0.7978260517120361, 0.9994087219238281, 0.9995530247688293, 0.8135138750076294, 0.999854564666748, 0.9166465997695923, 0.9976412057876587, 0.982892632484436, 0.9997021555900574, 0.9687736630439758], "len_token": 166, "len_probs": 166}

Therefore, it is possible that there are devices with the company logo that do not connect to the company's wifi and are not easy to operate. \n\nThe premises state that all of the devices that are easy to operate were produced after a new CTO is appointed, but they do not specify that ModelXX was produced after a new CTO is appointed. Therefore, it is possible that ModelXX was produced before the new CTO is appointed and is not with the company logo or connected to Google Home. \n\nTherefore, based on the premises, the conclusion that ModelXX is not with the company logo and managers do not control it is false.", "token_ids": [415, 12886, 349, 1341, 325, 28760, 609, 28705, 13, 13, 1014, 5146, 3900, 1665, 369, 544, 8309, 23921,

It is possible that Thomas does not go to the spa frequently, but it is also possible that he does. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is uncertain because it is based on incomplete or conflicting information.", "token_ids": [415, 12886, 349, 12518, 325, 28743, 609, 28705, 13, 13, 1014, 5146, 3900, 3084, 17358, 1157, 1871, 684, 6083, 28742, 28713, 6174, 304, 22731, 28723, 1418, 272, 624, 1021, 28725, 272, 5146, 3900, 3397, 369, 6083, 3069, 4045, 15186, 304, 17211, 4907, 304, 28033, 846, 11157, 354, 706, 297, 516, 1933, 727, 28723, 1418, 272, 799, 1021, 28725, 272, 5146, 3900, 3397, 369, 6083, 349, 459, 22172, 346, 304, 1235, 459, 927, 298, 4602, 264, 2475, 11580, 302, 516, 7904, 28723, 28705, 13, 13, 27955, 28725, 272, 5146, 3900, 511, 459, 3084, 2066, 1871, 298, 7655, 3161, 6083, 2590, 4859, 298, 272, 668, 28708, 11220, 442, 459, 28723, 661, 349, 2572, 369, 6083, 1235, 459, 576, 298, 272, 668, 28708, 11220, 28725, 562, 378, 349, 835, 2572, 369, 400, 1235, 28723, 28705, 13, 13, 5816, 994, 28725, 272, 12886, 349, 12518, 1096, 378, 349, 2818, 356, 297, 11192, 442, 17358, 1157, 1871, 28723], "token_probs": [0.5989933013916016, 0.9814184904098511, 0.8749650120735168, 0.5916869640350342, 0.8624465465545654, 0.9913215041160583, 0.6982698440551758, 0.2886275053024292, 0.9997429251670837, 0.8960956931114197, 0.3911019563674927, 0.8591698408126831, 0.9768367409706116, 0.26584842801094055, 0.2823328971862793, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9454589486122131, 0.7466182112693787, 0.6784330010414124, 0.8758412003517151, 0.9465476274490356, 0.6558188199996948, 0.7762215733528137, 0.7263268232345581, 0.8596272468566895, 0.5020453333854675, 0.4999846816062927, 0.9999591112136841, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9999905824661255, 0.322001188993454, 0.9539806842803955, 0.924022912979126, 0.9128060340881348, 0.9999957084655762, 0.6871390342712402, 0.6099236607551575, 0.9963546991348267, 0.999935507774353, 0.999995231628418, 0.9999548196792603, 0.9999561309814453, 0.620059072971344, 0.9257014989852905, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9989258646965027, 0.9999810457229614, 0.6164315938949585, 0.8536103367805481, 0.9999644756317139, 0.9998030066490173, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9750345945358276, 0.9618203043937683, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9999966621398926, 0.9497736692428589, 0.9962491393089294, 0.9996962547302246, 0.5287373065948486, 0.9999879598617554, 0.9916942715644836, 0.38329923152923584, 0.9946670532226562, 0.9725660681724548, 0.9999958276748657, 0.9956525564193726, 0.7791727185249329, 0.9999815225601196, 0.9982859492301941, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9999243021011353, 0.9998466968536377, 0.9951573014259338, 0.9998940229415894, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9998866319656372, 0.9999997615814209, 0.5911819338798523, 0.357186496257782, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9998445510864258, 0.37500157952308655, 0.9999958276748657, 0.5395759344100952, 0.5874575972557068, 0.9998083710670471, 0.9332294464111328, 0.9998437166213989, 0.9900656938552856, 0.7535721063613892, 0.9441477060317993, 0.9862891435623169, 0.7466461062431335, 0.8410589694976807, 0.9708458185195923, 0.7059800028800964, 0.4199436604976654, 0.9998912811279297, 0.9999059438705444, 0.9999966621398926, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9899750351905823, 0.9187926650047302, 0.8149650692939758, 0.9238904118537903, 0.4707411825656891, 0.9629247784614563, 0.9928227066993713, 0.9999845027923584, 0.9919376969337463, 0.5849572420120239, 0.5498359799385071, 0.9533853530883789, 0.999993085861206, 0.9999711513519287, 0.9999985694885254, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9565466642379761, 0.921681821346283, 0.40482231974601746, 0.3160325586795807, 0.9960028529167175, 0.9793158173561096, 0.9949740171432495, 0.9999904632568359, 0.9577620625495911, 0.9939360022544861, 0.7533548474311829, 0.4655453562736511, 0.999995231628418, 0.99998939037323, 0.8179563879966736, 0.9999794960021973, 0.9999961853027344, 0.7313958406448364, 0.9988160133361816, 0.5825519561767578, 0.9943960905075073, 0.46259668469429016, 0.7788544297218323, 0.45602473616600037, 0.9094606637954712, 0.9999814033508301, 0.4407561123371124, 0.9953125715255737, 0.861500084400177, 0.7787134647369385, 0.9999980926513672, 0.9849826693534851, 0.9765977263450623], "len_token": 153, "len_probs": 153}

However, the FLSA does not apply to all white-collar workers, and there are specific exemptions for certain types of employees, such as those in executive, administrative, and professional occupations. \n\nThe premises state that all lawyers are white-collar workers. While it is true that lawyers are typically considered white-collar workers, there are some exceptions, such as lawyers who work in certain types of industries or who have certain types of job duties. \n\nThe premises state that every advocate is a lawyer. While it is true that advocates are typically considered lawyers, there are some exceptions, such as advocates who work in certain types of industries or who have certain types of job duties. \n\nThe premises state that Mary is not a lawyer or a tipped employee.

Therefore, multivoxel (pattern) analysis is not the writing of a novel.", "token_ids": [415, 12886, 349, 1341, 325, 28760, 609, 9713, 449, 1142, 301, 325, 12392, 28731, 5643, 349, 264, 1212, 302, 6387, 1285, 5195, 369, 14657, 9131, 288, 1871, 477, 365, 12020, 15972, 28725, 690, 349, 264, 21256, 5340, 5643, 28723, 19920, 264, 7092, 28725, 356, 272, 799, 1021, 28725, 349, 264, 9811, 1759, 369, 1235, 459, 17516, 21256, 5340, 5643, 28723, 8469, 28725, 2531, 449, 1142, 301, 325, 12392, 28731, 5643, 349, 459, 272, 3653, 302, 264, 7092, 28723], "token_probs": [0.44100457429885864, 0.9795229434967041, 0.8680110573768616, 0.4978686571121216, 0.7664164304733276, 0.9982547163963318, 0.9691521525382996, 0.32837945222854614, 0.9999675750732422, 0.9999133348464966, 0.9999911785125732, 0.7637730240821838, 0.9999055862426758, 0.9999570846557617, 0.9999459981918335, 0.9698089361190796, 0.9700714945793152, 0.8608073592185974, 0.9999886751174927, 0.7576813101768494, 0.994208574295044, 0.9999985694885254, 0.6236447691917419, 0.5861075520515442, 0.742911159992218, 0.9999598264694214, 0.9989128112792969, 0.9998762607574463, 0.9043379426002502, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9973650574684143, 0.7359618544578552, 0.4320158064365387, 0.8536070585250854, 0.8083486557006836, 0.45095688104629517, 0.9528898000717163, 0.997358500957489, 0.693123459815979, 0.33235400915145874, 0.9992252588272095, 0.9999923706054688, 0.8664162755012512, 0.9961915016174316, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999793767929077, 0.9999842643737793, 0.9999964237213135, 0.4663706421852112, 0.8025650978088379, 0.9746478796005249, 0.6726763248443604, 0.9780275821685791, 0.6382112503051758, 0.9999004602432251, 0.963911235332489, 0.8733139038085938, 0.9832452535629272, 0.9999814033508301, 0.5279536843299866, 0.7273212671279907, 0.9999877214431763, 0.6355447769165039, 0.9999973773956299, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9999971389770508, 0.999168872833252, 0.9999885559082031, 0.9999920129776001, 0.9999873638153076, 0.5755581259727478, 0.8204816579818726, 0.9345313906669617, 0.8122564554214478, 0.9999954700469971, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9858065247535706], "len_token": 78, "len_probs": 78}

Therefore, it is possible that multivoxel (pattern) analysis could be a type of brain decoding that is without statistical pattern analysis, but it is not necessarily true that it is without statistical pattern analysis or writing a novel.", "token_ids": [415, 12886, 349, 12518, 325, 28743, 609, 4023, 272, 5146, 3900, 1665, 369, 544, 2273, 28733, 923, 288, 349, 2477, 6387, 4865, 442, 6387, 1285, 5195, 28725, 304, 369, 544, 6387, 1285, 5195, 369, 349, 2273, 28733, 923, 288, 349, 9131, 288, 1871, 477, 365, 12020, 15972, 28725, 590, 511, 459, 11867, 25385, 369, 544, 6387, 1285, 5195, 349, 1671, 21256, 5340, 5643, 28723, 16569, 28725, 272, 5146, 3900, 511, 459, 1665, 369, 544, 21256, 5340, 5643, 349, 1671, 3653, 264, 7092, 28723, 8469, 28725, 378, 349, 2572, 369, 2531, 449, 1142, 301, 325, 12392, 28731, 5643, 829, 347, 264, 1212, 302, 6387, 1285, 5195, 369, 349, 1671, 21256, 5340, 5643, 28725, 562, 378, 349, 459, 11867, 1132, 369, 378, 349, 1671, 21256, 5340, 5643, 442, 3653, 264, 7092, 28723], "token_probs": [0.47143086791038513, 0.9654161334037781, 0.8811652660369873, 0.3225802183151245, 0.8899989724159241, 0.9926128387451172, 0.8169682025909424, 0.27717822790145874, 0.4589828848838806, 0.9611995816230774, 0.9995670914649963, 0.2122330516576767, 0.9966369867324829, 0.49232614040374756, 0.46815142035484314, 0.9985647797584534, 0.9999892711639404, 0.9999879598617554, 0.9238519668579102, 0.9557712078094482, 0.9999690055847168, 0.9995266199111938, 0.9998317956924438, 0.9989792108535767, 0.9998846054077148, 0.9999990463256836, 0.7973626255989075, 0.7453155517578125, 0.6864684820175171, 0.8641884326934814, 0.9974076151847839, 0.9999175071716309, 0.9999955892562866, 0.9866126775741577, 0.9992272853851318, 0.9999804496765137, 0.9998075366020203, 0.9998958110809326, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9648606181144714, 0.9821917414665222, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9999923706054688, 0.9999810457229614, 0.9998494386672974, 0.999998927116394, 0.9999822378158569, 0.990373969078064, 0.6418647170066833, 0.9646872878074646, 0.9999796152114868, 0.23024241626262665, 0.8932856321334839, 0.9988042116165161, 0.5843298435211182, 0.5602889657020569, 0.759269118309021, 0.9999725818634033, 0.3418232500553131, 0.6876978874206543, 0.9987279772758484, 0.9996505975723267, 0.9999912977218628, 0.9370126724243164, 0.616938054561615, 0.999988317489624, 0.5130987167358398, 0.9880557060241699, 0.9240663647651672, 0.887908399105072, 0.999909520149231, 0.3117835819721222, 0.990639328956604, 0.6695377230644226, 0.3064214587211609, 0.9992642998695374, 0.998245120048523, 0.981507420539856, 0.745619535446167, 0.5715821385383606, 0.9991777539253235, 0.999969482421875, 0.6237419843673706, 0.8894420266151428, 0.9999830722808838, 0.6782351732254028, 0.9946361184120178, 0.5020836591720581, 0.7911052703857422, 0.8255473375320435, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9999940395355225, 0.9999985694885254, 0.9927768707275391, 0.9999624490737915, 0.9999946355819702, 0.999984622001648, 0.7581375241279602, 0.8262844085693359, 0.7228829264640808, 0.9732143878936768, 0.9999954700469971, 0.7110682129859924, 0.9948309063911438, 0.9999960660934448, 0.9798104763031006, 0.2851385474205017, 0.6935511827468872, 0.9995262622833252, 0.9999841451644897, 0.9999934434890747, 0.7448403239250183, 0.9079691171646118, 0.8138189315795898, 0.9390120506286621, 0.49709296226501465, 0.6379489302635193, 0.5454365611076355, 0.9667580723762512, 0.8886091113090515, 0.9948947429656982, 0.9691573977470398, 0.9246208667755127, 0.9999672174453735, 0.9999808073043823, 0.959931492805481, 0.9859861135482788, 0.9999884366989136, 0.9999935626983643, 0.9845921397209167], "len_token": 130, "len_probs": 130}

Therefore, it is possible that arthritis could have mutations without being cancerous. \n\nThe premises also state that no mutations can be treated at home, but this does not apply to all types of mutations. For example, some mutations may be treatable with medications or other therapies that can be administered at home. \n\nThe premises also state that all colorectal cancers are cancers, but this is not necessarily true. Colorectal cancer is a specific type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum, but there are other types of cancer that can occur in these organs as well. \n\nFinally, the premises state that a cold can be treated at home, but this is not necessarily true.
