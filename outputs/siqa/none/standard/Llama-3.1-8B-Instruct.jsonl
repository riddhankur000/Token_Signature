While it's possible that Casey might talk about the situation after being informed, this is not the primary reason for Cameron sharing the information.\n\n(C) \"Give a helping hand\" is not relevant to the context, as the question is about sharing information, not providing assistance.", "token_ids": [271, 791, 4495, 4320, 374, 320, 33, 1680, 2100, 45624, 7020, 922, 279, 6671, 382, 2028, 4320, 374, 68695, 505, 279, 2317, 315, 279, 3488, 11, 902, 13533, 430, 27524, 6222, 2038, 449, 45624, 922, 1148, 7077, 13, 578, 17571, 330, 70, 525, 45624, 264, 5647, 315, 4455, 814, 5602, 1, 24897, 430, 27524, 16369, 45624, 922, 279, 4455, 11, 779, 430, 45624, 1053, 387, 8010, 315, 1148, 7077, 13, 1115, 374, 264, 4279, 2944, 369, 11821, 2038, 449, 4423, 11, 311, 2567, 1124, 16369, 13, 4815, 791, 1023, 2671, 656, 539, 5052, 279, 2317, 439, 1664, 1473, 4444, 8, 330, 4516, 45624, 1436, 3137, 922, 279, 6671, 1, 374, 539, 14647, 279, 2944, 369, 27524, 11821, 279, 2038, 13, 6104, 433, 596, 3284, 430, 45624, 2643, 3137, 922, 279, 6671, 1306, 1694, 16369, 11, 420, 374, 539, 279, 6156, 2944, 369, 27524, 11821, 279, 2038, 382, 3100, 8, 330, 36227, 264, 10695, 1450, 1, 374, 539, 9959, 311, 279, 2317, 11, 439, 279, 3488, 374, 922, 11821, 2038, 11, 539, 8405, 13291, 13], "token_probs": [0.9654303789138794, 0.8273240327835083, 0.7791299223899841, 0.7918771505355835, 0.9988982677459717, 0.8323174715042114, 0.5503024458885193, 0.7973320484161377, 0.9901307821273804, 0.9965276122093201, 0.7059299349784851, 0.9982403516769409, 0.9996627569198608, 0.9998714923858643, 0.6365376114845276, 0.443798303604126, 0.3147442638874054, 0.285816490650177, 0.3145585358142853, 0.5564815998077393, 0.9984428286552429, 0.4565165638923645, 0.5086694955825806, 0.9776312708854675, 0.46562325954437256, 0.6803772449493408, 0.9138332605361938, 0.37036851048469543, 0.994917631149292, 0.9945493340492249, 0.30381399393081665, 0.559026300907135, 0.8861170411109924, 0.9988909363746643, 0.43368861079216003, 0.6256523132324219, 0.6773592829704285, 0.587229311466217, 0.7282181978225708, 0.28663429617881775, 0.9990516304969788, 0.9600382447242737, 0.9999665021896362, 0.9509370923042297, 0.9996951818466187, 0.9998619556427002, 0.9990454316139221, 0.9907584190368652, 0.9391257166862488, 0.998602569103241, 0.9999489784240723, 0.958858072757721, 0.9982820749282837, 0.988672137260437, 0.2735050916671753, 0.8342724442481995, 0.9804979562759399, 0.6512851119041443, 0.5693807005882263, 0.5239624381065369, 0.3558855950832367, 0.8439591526985168, 0.9930589199066162, 0.5933789014816284, 0.7952030301094055, 0.9787107110023499, 0.9972042441368103, 0.6485211253166199, 0.4019380509853363, 0.941836416721344, 0.3680466115474701, 0.5038626790046692, 0.448243647813797, 0.49744322896003723, 0.8952062726020813, 0.6436434984207153, 0.7557942271232605, 0.9984093308448792, 0.6433946490287781, 0.9814273715019226, 0.6857520341873169, 0.43309155106544495, 0.6128370761871338, 0.999849796295166, 0.9944421648979187, 0.40675434470176697, 0.48586854338645935, 0.7792856097221375, 0.9915407299995422, 0.9937606453895569, 0.4714576303958893, 0.999970555305481, 0.4584735035896301, 0.550316572189331, 0.9899896383285522, 0.49353277683258057, 0.996981680393219, 0.7742120623588562, 0.932596743106842, 0.9465101361274719, 0.7787553668022156, 0.9990622401237488, 0.9998689889907837, 0.9998251795768738, 0.9999713897705078, 0.9999572038650513, 0.9998569488525391, 0.9999929666519165, 0.9931997656822205, 0.44863855838775635, 0.5929795503616333, 0.32502612471580505, 0.42820101976394653, 0.6777613162994385, 0.3257410228252411, 0.5520776510238647, 0.6297128200531006, 0.6498298645019531, 0.9982166886329651, 0.49523332715034485, 0.4380496144294739, 0.8416234254837036, 0.9010050892829895, 0.9978456497192383, 0.8846040368080139, 0.6878182888031006, 0.8639702796936035, 0.5835473537445068, 0.9971488118171692, 0.8999021649360657, 0.999081015586853, 0.49971240758895874, 0.7748127579689026, 0.9816623330116272, 0.9873955845832825, 0.33984699845314026, 0.9675263166427612, 0.9988793730735779, 0.9797143340110779, 0.8978272080421448, 0.8663626909255981, 0.4974328577518463, 0.9099399447441101, 0.5392427444458008, 0.9649938941001892, 0.993091344833374, 0.9896135926246643, 0.9995269775390625, 0.9993072748184204, 0.9995842576026917, 0.9909886717796326, 0.999940037727356, 0.9997734427452087, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9999490976333618, 0.8631171584129333, 0.6590980291366577, 0.4348084330558777, 0.9622276425361633, 0.9905795454978943, 0.8894464373588562, 0.3322213888168335, 0.9451324343681335, 0.4149262011051178, 0.602485179901123, 0.46953168511390686, 0.8449164032936096, 0.7422346472740173, 0.9987598657608032, 0.9508292078971863, 0.9999904632568359, 0.5581429600715637, 0.5408554673194885, 0.9466738104820251], "len_token": 174, "len_probs": 174}

Getting angry (A) and destroying (B) the snowman would be opposite of what Robin is likely to do, as they would be actions that would undo the effort Robin put into building the snowman.", "token_ids": [271, 791, 4495, 4320, 374, 320, 34, 1680, 2231, 264, 75294, 304, 279, 19689, 382, 791, 3488, 5415, 430, 17582, 5918, 264, 12056, 1543, 323, 6688, 433, 264, 502, 836, 11, 902, 24897, 430, 17582, 374, 4737, 459, 2802, 304, 279, 12056, 1543, 323, 374, 4461, 311, 1390, 311, 923, 1063, 25270, 29727, 311, 433, 13, 78990, 264, 75294, 304, 279, 19689, 374, 264, 4279, 5820, 5938, 449, 4857, 264, 12056, 1543, 11, 439, 433, 374, 264, 8776, 4668, 315, 264, 12056, 1543, 596, 3663, 13, 4815, 791, 1023, 2671, 656, 539, 1304, 5647, 304, 420, 2317, 13, 25531, 19021, 320, 32, 8, 323, 33812, 320, 33, 8, 279, 12056, 1543, 1053, 387, 14329, 315, 1148, 17582, 374, 4461, 311, 656, 11, 439, 814, 1053, 387, 6299, 430, 1053, 29821, 279, 5149, 17582, 2231, 1139, 4857, 279, 12056, 1543, 13], "token_probs": [0.9884294271469116, 0.7071879506111145, 0.7063820362091064, 0.9618266820907593, 0.9968344569206238, 0.7611604928970337, 0.9958711266517639, 0.9013476371765137, 0.9864158630371094, 0.9997243285179138, 0.9999501705169678, 0.999708354473114, 0.9996180534362793, 0.9998481273651123, 0.6460768580436707, 0.3124648630619049, 0.3880341649055481, 0.5538854598999023, 0.9835837483406067, 0.9784548878669739, 0.8418379426002502, 0.9976091384887695, 0.9997469782829285, 0.9999679327011108, 0.9070109724998474, 0.9871290922164917, 0.9997885823249817, 0.9998113512992859, 0.9668183326721191, 0.999958872795105, 0.8474805951118469, 0.43542391061782837, 0.5159526467323303, 0.9860972762107849, 0.9646272659301758, 0.5629686117172241, 0.4500952661037445, 0.38907235860824585, 0.7345793843269348, 0.9705874919891357, 0.7520847916603088, 0.9964960217475891, 0.9999568462371826, 0.9374496340751648, 0.43062734603881836, 0.32311388850212097, 0.6013333797454834, 0.7747417688369751, 0.9998440742492676, 0.372237890958786, 0.3659196197986603, 0.44549041986465454, 0.9977496266365051, 0.47513341903686523, 0.7636470794677734, 0.916111409664154, 0.8126900792121887, 0.9999282360076904, 0.99992835521698, 0.9969608187675476, 0.9957683086395264, 0.9463608860969543, 0.941481351852417, 0.9996249675750732, 0.9125721454620361, 0.35396596789360046, 0.2943156361579895, 0.9999886751174927, 0.7040277719497681, 0.4089928865432739, 0.9983189702033997, 0.999913215637207, 0.8801628947257996, 0.4814456105232239, 0.9707489013671875, 0.719477117061615, 0.5656636953353882, 0.3337668478488922, 0.5248411297798157, 0.8954890966415405, 0.5710356831550598, 0.974299967288971, 0.9987967014312744, 0.8958257436752319, 0.9680813550949097, 0.9701204299926758, 0.36320948600769043, 0.4906899631023407, 0.9827387928962708, 0.9974128603935242, 0.6760754585266113, 0.9999841451644897, 0.7168856263160706, 0.9762225151062012, 0.978623628616333, 0.5603929162025452, 0.9989882111549377, 0.7790051698684692, 0.7947316765785217, 0.9997839331626892, 0.591800332069397, 0.992375910282135, 0.9999805688858032, 0.429721862077713, 0.9910564422607422, 0.4135221540927887, 0.9998158812522888, 0.9999651908874512, 0.8273460268974304, 0.9999886751174927, 0.9999836683273315, 0.7475278973579407, 0.770184338092804, 0.24033084511756897, 0.5863288044929504, 0.7923736572265625, 0.5596596002578735, 0.32720768451690674, 0.4413769841194153, 0.9842929244041443, 0.5617928504943848, 0.5246116518974304, 0.6802830696105957, 0.372869610786438, 0.43208029866218567, 0.3249473571777344, 0.16552004218101501, 0.7396469712257385, 0.5247210264205933, 0.2746616303920746, 0.8117146492004395, 0.5241986513137817, 0.5998950004577637, 0.8949515223503113, 0.9902830123901367, 0.9788195490837097, 0.8474158644676208, 0.9999780654907227, 0.9999744892120361, 0.9686398506164551], "len_token": 140, "len_probs": 140}

This is because the sentence implies that Kendall will be presenting their film to a large audience, which would include many strangers.", "token_ids": [16533, 25, 320, 33, 1680, 3137, 311, 264, 2763, 315, 40721, 198, 70869, 25, 720, 791, 11914, 374, 304, 279, 28979, 7899, 13, 578, 3917, 315, 279, 11914, 374, 330, 42, 408, 543, 498, 323, 279, 1957, 374, 330, 53757, 287, 311, 3118, 872, 4668, 4632, 3343, 578, 11914, 374, 34030, 439, 330, 13317, 489, 60314, 489, 3075, 498, 1405, 330, 42, 408, 543, 1, 374, 279, 3917, 11, 330, 53757, 287, 1, 374, 279, 19120, 11, 323, 330, 29844, 872, 4668, 4632, 1, 374, 279, 1665, 13, 578, 11914, 374, 304, 279, 28979, 7899, 1606, 279, 5357, 374, 389, 279, 1957, 1694, 2884, 311, 74176, 11, 4856, 1109, 74176, 3815, 279, 1957, 13, 4815, 791, 4495, 4320, 374, 320, 33, 8, 330, 36341, 311, 264, 2763, 315, 40721, 3343, 1115, 374, 1606, 279, 11914, 24897, 430, 74176, 690, 387, 32644, 872, 4632, 311, 264, 3544, 10877, 11, 902, 1053, 2997, 1690, 40721, 13], "token_probs": [0.9961802959442139, 0.8512995839118958, 0.4609520435333252, 0.5680833458900452, 0.8557383418083191, 0.9128230214118958, 0.9994024038314819, 0.9978148937225342, 0.9993584752082825, 0.9996117949485779, 0.9997785687446594, 0.3331206738948822, 0.25225797295570374, 0.9717166423797607, 0.11670908331871033, 0.15108676254749298, 0.2509481608867645, 0.16992297768592834, 0.20556120574474335, 0.8768178820610046, 0.7123726606369019, 0.9816239476203918, 0.37035587430000305, 0.35844796895980835, 0.6352738738059998, 0.30166247487068176, 0.9252532720565796, 0.9355464577674866, 0.5965872406959534, 0.652264416217804, 0.8275957107543945, 0.9994325041770935, 0.951845645904541, 0.3542538583278656, 0.5679974555969238, 0.9560360312461853, 0.44284483790397644, 0.31595197319984436, 0.7436459064483643, 0.26496654748916626, 0.9889842867851257, 0.8131099939346313, 0.9672216773033142, 0.6344177722930908, 0.9349349737167358, 0.9968357682228088, 0.6306120753288269, 0.5086438059806824, 0.1863994151353836, 0.33118078112602234, 0.24406063556671143, 0.7222365140914917, 0.6467869877815247, 0.3582514524459839, 0.7946613430976868, 0.13862410187721252, 0.6581985950469971, 0.43924856185913086, 0.6158660650253296, 0.513713538646698, 0.6345959901809692, 0.6307922005653381, 0.99930739402771, 0.8508558869361877, 0.984708309173584, 0.9891831874847412, 0.9751653075218201, 0.9636755585670471, 0.4809478521347046, 0.8964971303939819, 0.945244550704956, 0.9984862804412842, 0.5903527736663818, 0.9955339431762695, 0.9785662889480591, 0.8570718765258789, 0.8533735275268555, 0.9975064396858215, 0.9750556945800781, 0.4770260453224182, 0.9821489453315735, 0.986610472202301, 0.9988455772399902, 0.9972449541091919, 0.9988094568252563, 0.9980581402778625, 0.9841667413711548, 0.8657236695289612, 0.3182727098464966, 0.3274872601032257, 0.5778758525848389, 0.287689745426178, 0.975173830986023, 0.6980257034301758, 0.998330295085907, 0.9274844527244568, 0.5858750939369202, 0.703340470790863, 0.9957276582717896, 0.9943351149559021, 0.9343112707138062, 0.7930334806442261, 0.33051085472106934, 0.5456247925758362, 0.8884948492050171, 0.48056691884994507, 0.5456644892692566, 0.940509021282196, 0.9996591806411743, 0.4181390702724457, 0.7513235807418823, 0.9830907583236694, 0.9998144507408142, 0.9145896434783936, 0.25575652718544006, 0.30601832270622253, 0.6004514694213867, 0.8742749691009521, 0.7464439868927002, 0.6471649408340454, 0.9953244924545288, 0.6582022905349731, 0.4401926100254059, 0.9753143787384033, 0.9995527863502502, 0.99919193983078, 0.9999004602432251, 0.9997536540031433, 0.999666690826416, 0.4904869496822357, 0.5851460695266724, 0.7000048756599426, 0.7503617405891418, 0.47335296869277954, 0.7692502737045288, 0.46982136368751526, 0.998144268989563, 0.7902476787567139, 0.385177880525589, 0.3780704140663147, 0.47077253460884094, 0.9721864461898804, 0.6747743487358093, 0.756955623626709, 0.5040328502655029, 0.5521214604377747, 0.42950037121772766, 0.9378798007965088, 0.7562181949615479, 0.5879915952682495, 0.3171521723270416, 0.5301766991615295, 0.7535101771354675, 0.9228261709213257], "len_token": 154, "len_probs": 154}

decision-making, which is not necessarily a direct consequence of the situation.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because it implies that a mutual friend will intervene to mediate the conflict, which is not mentioned in the scenario.\n\nOption (C) is the most likely outcome, as the fact that Carson tried to fight Robin but decided not to suggests that the conflict is still unresolved, and it's

Option (B) is also incorrect because there's no indication that Tracy asked for a guide, and the sentence doesn't mention a guide at all.", "token_ids": [271, 791, 4495, 4320, 374, 320, 34, 1680, 1095, 279, 6980, 617, 2523, 382, 791, 11914, 5415, 430, 60342, 3952, 40271, 596, 4236, 389, 264, 2115, 8577, 11, 902, 24897, 430, 279, 7580, 315, 279, 8577, 374, 311, 3493, 459, 32180, 3217, 369, 279, 4236, 13, 578, 2144, 430, 433, 596, 264, 2115, 8577, 311, 264, 24925, 315, 8198, 323, 3925, 13533, 430, 433, 596, 264, 2523, 323, 16627, 65281, 11, 4856, 1109, 264, 32227, 14584, 477, 6129, 5820, 382, 5454, 320, 32, 8, 374, 15465, 1606, 1418, 6975, 1253, 387, 264, 555, 3107, 315, 279, 8577, 11, 433, 596, 539, 279, 6156, 2944, 369, 4737, 279, 4236, 389, 279, 8577, 13, 7104, 320, 33, 8, 374, 1101, 15465, 1606, 1070, 596, 912, 28137, 430, 60342, 4691, 369, 264, 8641, 11, 323, 279, 11914, 3250, 956, 6420, 264, 8641, 520, 682, 13], "token_probs": [0.9983395338058472, 0.7940549254417419, 0.788748025894165, 0.9954053163528442, 0.9991366267204285, 0.8869624733924866, 0.8439765572547913, 0.8518283367156982, 0.9913544058799744, 0.9999221563339233, 0.9999881982803345, 0.999890923500061, 0.9997313618659973, 0.9224411845207214, 0.6690107583999634, 0.6724206209182739, 0.22948144376277924, 0.9203794598579407, 0.8955701589584351, 0.6753956079483032, 0.8552691340446472, 0.999858021736145, 0.9919735193252563, 0.9347680807113647, 0.9971646666526794, 0.9360856413841248, 0.9999371767044067, 0.456706702709198, 0.8280928730964661, 0.6206563115119934, 0.9181320667266846, 0.8283470869064331, 0.6625771522521973, 0.7203388214111328, 0.9982457160949707, 0.8425769209861755, 0.5310330986976624, 0.6188000440597534, 0.6119585037231445, 0.5376719236373901, 0.7519535422325134, 0.8679919242858887, 0.999627947807312, 0.9949506521224976, 0.796823263168335, 0.5448533296585083, 0.6373133063316345, 0.316472589969635, 0.9999529123306274, 0.7167856097221375, 0.5867829322814941, 0.5722560286521912, 0.8454856276512146, 0.9990429282188416, 0.5640233159065247, 0.796934187412262, 0.9008630514144897, 0.33729827404022217, 0.9948230981826782, 0.9999709129333496, 0.9999372959136963, 0.4800364375114441, 0.8126749396324158, 0.5201268196105957, 0.9690528512001038, 0.405294805765152, 0.4937441349029541, 0.9137346148490906, 0.786018967628479, 0.8547372221946716, 0.6342885494232178, 0.48269811272621155, 0.9999653100967407, 0.9208589792251587, 0.37383127212524414, 0.8408275246620178, 0.5635507106781006, 0.23370814323425293, 0.2239161878824234, 0.5139371752738953, 0.44938790798187256, 0.9902247786521912, 0.9903883337974548, 0.9805403351783752, 0.5269153714179993, 0.6156405806541443, 0.9994439482688904, 0.836154580116272, 0.4222313463687897, 0.2878919839859009, 0.971894383430481, 0.9957270622253418, 0.5280733704566956, 0.9996520280838013, 0.9996629953384399, 0.9592483639717102, 0.8163138628005981, 0.9999808073043823, 0.9852244853973389, 0.9899318218231201, 0.9959547519683838, 0.9579670429229736, 0.9678331613540649, 0.8367965221405029, 0.4705318510532379, 0.6024789214134216, 0.9551602602005005, 0.8498048186302185, 0.5316329598426819, 0.7039733529090881, 0.7052626013755798, 0.7966040372848511, 0.9653529524803162, 0.9999703168869019, 0.9998852014541626, 0.9990787506103516, 0.9849286675453186, 0.9598242044448853, 0.9926989674568176, 0.9960922598838806, 0.42923858761787415, 0.7309327125549316, 0.996817946434021, 0.9387205839157104, 0.8519218564033508, 0.8133366703987122, 0.5752013921737671, 0.9735095500946045, 0.9962742328643799, 0.9988813996315002, 0.5145174264907837, 0.477071613073349, 0.4407249093055725, 0.6068522334098816, 0.8464897871017456, 0.9999974966049194, 0.7230319976806641, 0.4223921298980713, 0.9893279671669006, 0.4886002242565155, 0.9999858140945435, 0.962475597858429], "len_token": 142, "len_probs": 142}

However, the question asks how Sasha would feel \"afterwards\", implying that the nap has already occurred.
